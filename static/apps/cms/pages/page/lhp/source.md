Supported browsers:

* Firefox 40.0+
* Google Chrome

# Installation

## For Google Chrome
You can install this extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-home-page/gcmoighfngkbamcclibkopgljgamjfki).

## For Firefox
This version is now discontinued. Mozilla's messing with its browser, so I'm not going to use it. If Firefox will be usable again, I will consider about updating this extension.
