# General Information

This is a lighter version of main Twitch site.

One of the main features of this application is a support for Streamlink application, which allows to play streams in any video player application.

Idea of this application was to allow users to watch Twitch streams without Flash plugin, when Twitch was only offering Flash player.

# Project Status

As of February 11, 2017, this project is no longer maintained and I don't have any intention to continue working on it.

I had to stop the development due to constatnt API changes and problems with connection to video streams.

As a replacement, I can only suggest to use [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) site, because now it allows to watch streams in HTML5 player.
